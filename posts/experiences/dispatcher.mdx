- Implement an email template system in Go, entirely customizable by users.
- Worked on a new **Go backend** to improve performance of the previous backend.
- Improved the performance of existing APIs, optimize the existing SQL requests and add many new features to the API.
- I also worked on the **Vue.js** frontend to improve it and add new features and pages.
