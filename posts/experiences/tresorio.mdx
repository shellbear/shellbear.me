- I mainly worked on the Cloud rendering part, it's a Blender add-on that's [open source](https://github.com/Tresorio/pablo).
- I had to work on a **Go** backend server that renders **Blender** scenes.
- I improved the performance, scalability and make it reusable before adding many new features to it.
- I worked on a new **Gitlab CI/CD** pipeline for testing all micro-services.
- I automated deployment for services (**Go**, **React**, **Typescript**, **Python**...).
